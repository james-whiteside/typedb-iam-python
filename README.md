# TypeDB IAM Python (UNMAINTAINED)

This was a personal proof of concept for the TypeDB IAM project and is not officially supported by Vaticle.
As such, I no longer maintain this repo and provide no guarantees that the code will be functional.
If you would like to pick up where I left off, please feel free to continue working on it on your own fork.
I will not be responding to issues or pull requests, and this repo may be made private at any time.
